You can install it by entering the following command in the terminal:\nxcode-select --install In addition, this tutorial is based on Anaconda, but you can also create a virtual environment using Miniconda or Virtualenv. You can download and install Anaconda from here. Please find the appropriate version and follow the installation instructions on the official website. The installation process will not be repeated here. After installing Anaconda, Python can be used directly. However, if you want to use conda to create a virtual environment, you need to initialize conda by entering the following command in the terminal:\nconda init Installing Tensorflow and Tensorflow Metal # First, create a virtual environment based on Python 3.8:\nconda create -n tensorflow python=3.8 Then, activate the virtual environment:\nconda activate tensorflow Install the dependencies for Tensorflow and Tensorflow Metal:\nconda install -c apple tensorflow-deps If you encounter any issues with finding the installation package, add the following command to the .condarc file in your user folder to enable installation:\nsubdirs: - osx-arm64 Next, based on the versions of tensorflow-macos and tensorflow-metal listed in the table at the bottom of the official website\u0026rsquo;s Get started with tensorflow-metal page, use the following command to install Tensorflow and the Tensorflow Metal plugin (the metal plugin enables GPU acceleration for machine learning):\npython -m pip install tensorflow-macos==2.9 tensorflow-metal==0.5.0 Testing the Installation # If you also need to install Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following command:\nconda install -c conda-forge -y jupyter You can use the following script to test and run Tensorflow (or you can use the code from the official website):\nimport tensorflow as tf print(tf.__version__) print(tf.config.list_physical_devices(\u0026#39;GPU\u0026#39;)) If the output is:\n2.9.0 [PhysicalDevice(name=\u0026#39;/physical_device:GPU:0\u0026#39;, device_type=\u0026#39;GPU\u0026#39;)] Congratulations!

Compared to other search algorithms, it has a low time complexity. This article will introduce the basic idea of binary search and how to implement it.\nBasic Idea of Binary Search # In a nutshell: Divide and conquer until the target is found. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by analyzing the simplest case. Suppose we have an array \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\) sorted in ascending order. If we want to find a specific number \\(a_i\\), the brute-force method would be to start from the first number and search one by one until we find the desired number. In the worst case, the target number is the last number, resulting in a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\) for this search.\nInstead, we can take out the middle number \\(a_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}\\) and compare it with the target \\(a_i\\). If the middle value is greater than the target value, since the array is sorted, the target value must be in the left half of the array. Otherwise, the target value must be in the right half of the array. This way, we narrow down the search range by half each time, and we can eventually find the target number. The time complexity of this search is \\(O(\\log n)\\).\nImplementation of Binary Search # The implementation of binary search is straightforward. We just need to translate the above idea into code, taking care of handling the boundary values. Here\u0026rsquo;s the code in Java:\npublic int search(int[] nums, int target) { int left = 0, right = nums.length; while(left \u0026lt; right) { // Excluding the right node, so initially right = nums.length-1+1 int middle = left + (right - left \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 1); // To prevent array overflow, bitwise operation is used instead of division by 2 for better efficiency (When does overflow occur?) if(nums[middle] \u0026gt; target) { // If the middle value is greater than the target value, the target value must be in the left half of the array right = middle; } else if(nums[middle] \u0026lt; target) { // If the middle value is less than the target value, the target value must be in the right half of the array left = middle + 1; } else { return middle; } } return -1; } ","date":"21 March 2023","permalink":"/algorithm/binarysearch/","section":"Algorithms","summary":"","title":"Binary Search"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/binarysearch/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"BinarySearch"}]
